# predictive-powers
A Java library to (easily?) access OpenAI API.

#Installation

  * This library depends on Jackson [data-binding](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) and [annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations),
  and on [Lomboc](https://projectlombok.org/) libraries.
  
  These are correctly references within the pom.xml file for this project. However, to have Lomboc to work, you need to *install it in Eclipse* or any other IDE you are using, as explained on Lomboc website.
