			+ "You have now completed a number of activities focused mainly on the psychological content of this weekâ€™s study. In this section, you will move on to the methods and skills component.\n"
			+ "Last week you were introduced to some general principles that frame the use of qualitative methodologies. This week you are going to look in more detail at one specific method for analysing qualitative data: thematic analysis. You first learned about thematic analysis in DE100, in Chapter 6 of Investigating Methods, â€˜Addressing qualitative data through thematic analysisâ€™. Before working though this Methods and skills section, you may find it helpful to revisit this chapter, as well as Online Activity 18.1: Analysing recorded data, in which you had an opportunity to use a basic thematic analysis to examine an extract from a group discussion.\n"
			+ "As part of your methods learning on DE200, you have slowly been building up your methods toolkit to allow you to ask and answer the various research questions you might have. In Blocks 1 and 2 of this module, you came across the statistical decision tree, which not only aims to help you to make decisions about which tests are most appropriate to use when, but also serves as an illustration of exactly how much youâ€™ve learned.\n"
			+ "In Block 3 you will be adding another branch to the tree, â€˜Looking for meaningâ€™, and this week the focus will be on Thematic Analysis.\n"
			+ "This tree should help you to understand how the different methods relate to and differ from one another, and give you an idea of the circumstances under which each should be used. The next few sections will give you a chance to use what you have learned by asking you to identify the most appropriate methods to use in various different research scenarios.\n"
			+ "Thematic analysis (TA) is a technique used widely across the social sciences, including psychology (Braun and Clarke, 2006; 2022). It  is a method for organising qualitative data into patterns called themes. A theme can be thought of as a pattern of recurrent ideas, topics and statements that meaningfully go together and that are expressed in one piece of data (e.g. one personâ€™s interview) or across several data points (e.g. several peopleâ€™s interviews).\n"
			+ "Thematic analysis, as understood in Braun and Clarkeâ€™s terms, does not require any quantiï¬cation of data. Therefore, data is not collected in a numerical form, nor is data turned into numbers (e.g. counting how many times participants mention the word â€˜angryâ€™ in a study of emotion). Instead, it is a process where patterns are identified in the dataset through familiarisation, coding and development of themes. These themes are central in answering your research question.\n"
			+ "Thematic analysis forms the basis of some specific forms of analysis that you briefly looked at last week (e.g. phenomenological analyses and grounded theory) and is often used as the starting point for organising data meaningfully before other kinds of analysis (e.g. some forms of discourse analysis) are performed. Thematic analysis is also frequently used as a method of analysis in its own right.\n"
			+ "Braun and Clarke (2006; 2022) identify six phases of thematic analysis that move through processes of exploring the data, looking for meaning, identifying patterns and grouping these. This is not necessarily intended to be a set of ï¬xed, independent phases to be completed in turn, and in practice we often move between phases, returning to and repeating earlier phases until we are satisï¬ed with the outcome overall. Rather than thinking of the analytical process as a line, we can instead think of it as a spiral, which allows us to move between data, codes and themes. However, in general, when starting out with thematic analysis the six-phase process is likely to fit the purpose of most researchers.\n"
			+ "This first phase involves getting your data ready and becoming familiar with it before going through it in more detail. Thematic analysis requires the researcher to become immersed in their data. This process usually starts with transcription; there is no better way of getting to know your data than by listening carefully and typing out what your interviewees say. This process involves transcribing the data verbatim (word for word) and making decisions about what level of detail is needed for analysis.\n"
			+ "Transcriptions typically just involve recording the words that were uttered in an interview (i.e. a â€˜verbatimâ€™ transcript) but might also include paraverbal information (e.g. coughing, laughing, pauses in speech, etc.). There are no hard-and-fast rules about the level of detail you should include when transcribing. The transcription conventions you use will depend on the information you need in order to conduct the analysis appropriate to your research question.\n"
			+ "Thematic analysis can be used on data already in written form (e.g. newspaper articles, written diaries and pre-existing interview data). This is referred to as â€˜secondary dataâ€™, where the researcher hasnâ€™t collected the primary data themselves. In these instances, there may still be a need to prepare the data for analysis, for example by putting it in a word-processing document or PDF for editing online or printing.\n"
			+ "Whether or not you have done your own transcription, before you get into coding you need to become very familiar with the data. As you may recall from DE100, familiarisation involves reading and rereading the data. You may also remember that listening to original audio files is an important part of familiarisation should you be working with audio-recorded data. It is sometimes useful to listen to the audio recording at the same time as reading the related transcription. This is because audio recordings contain slightly different information from transcriptions â€“ information that can be useful for identifying features of the data that could be relevant for the analysis. It is a good idea to make notes and highlight interesting parts of the transcript during this familiarisation process.\n"
			+ "We are going to use a worked example to illustrate the thematic analysis process, starting with familiarisation. The example will analyse a newspaper article fromÂ The Guardian, which engages some of the key points raised in this weekâ€™s chapter. The article, â€˜Lucky boy raised without gender stereotypesâ€™ (Roberts, 2012), reports the story of Beck Laxton and Kieran Cooper, who decided to try to avoid gender stereotyping when raising their child, Sasha.\n"
			+ "The analysis of this article will be based on the following research question:Â How are gender-neutral approaches to parenting described and understood?\n"
			+ "Analysis example: 1\n"
			+ "As described earlier, the first step in the analytical process is to familiarise yourself with the data. Start by reading the transcript of the article. You might also like to listen to the audio version of the article provide here. As was pointed out earlier, listening is a different skill from reading and can carry different information. Most researchers find it helpful to listen to the audio of the data as well as reading the related transcript.\n"
			+ "You might need to listen to and read the data a number of times to feel familiar with it. You might also find it helpful to make broad, general notes on things that strike you as important or interesting as you familiarise yourself with this data. For example, the article seems to take a positive view of Laxton and Cooperâ€™s parenting approach. It is useful to make a note of these general observations, as they can be used to inform later stages of analysis.\n"
			+ "Once you have familiarised yourself with the data, next comes the coding. Coding is the process of labelling a segment of data in a way that captures what is meaningful about it. Remember that the purpose of thematic analysis is to generate broad patterns or themes, often across multiple texts. But it is important not to jump to themes too quickly. We need a systematic and rigorous way of exploring the data and starting to identify parts of the text that look potentially interesting, meaningful and relevant to the research question. This is what you are doing when you start your coding.\n"
			+ "Coding isnâ€™t a single, linear process and the way you carry it out can vary, but it can be useful to think about coding as two broad steps of initial coding and developing codes. Initial coding involves a first exploration of the data, and then developing codes is concerned with sharpening and refining these ideas before moving to themes. We will look at the initial coding here before moving to developed codes.\n"
			+ "For datasets that contain multiple transcripts you usually start by coding one complete transcript then moving on to the rest of the transcripts in your dataset. Initial codes are generally produced for every line or couple of lines of the text you are analysing. There are lots of different ways that you can do your initial coding, but you should keep the following overarching principles in mind (adapted from Braun and Clarke, 2022):\n"
			+ "Itâ€™s worth pausing here to think about how you go about this practically. We suggested in the familiarisation phase that you might want to save your text as a Word document or PDF. You can work electronically or print these off and work with hard copies. Any of these options can work just as well, and no one method is inherently better than the other â€“ the analytic process should be essentially the same whatever practical method you choose. Here are some of the main ways that you might like to code your data (Braun and Clarke, 2022):\n"
			+ "When starting coding, try to keep your research question in mind. With your research question as a starting point, you should find it useful to consider the questions in Box 1, below; they will help you think through what is interesting and meaningful about the chunk of text you are working with.\n"
			+ "Analysis example: 2\n"
			+ "Turning back to our example, now that you are familiar with the data and have a good sense of what it is about, you are ready to begin assigning initial codes, using the principles above. Remember this first step is about trying to find a succinct way of describing and summarising the content of the article.\n"
			+ "There is no one right way to go about initial coding but most researchers take a line-by-line approach, which involves going through the text carefully from start to finish. In our example we have created a column on the right-hand side of the transcript to note down associations or ideas that come to mind when reading a particular sentence. You can also use the helpful questions from Box 1 when thinking of your codes. In our example, these questions might translate to:\n"
			+ "Letâ€™s take a closer look at the process of initial coding by considering the headline of the article: â€˜Lucky boy raised without gender stereotypesâ€™. In this headline, the boy is described as â€˜luckyâ€™, which conveys a specific message about his upbringing â€“ that it was a positive one. The words â€˜luckyâ€™ and â€˜positive experienceâ€™ can therefore be noted as initial codes.\n"
			+ "This process of making observations and thinking about how we can interpret each line can be done for the whole article, as shown in the document below.\n"
			+ "It is important to acknowledge the role that we, as researchers, play in the analytic process. Our subjectivity will shape how we view the data, and what we notice in the text, but this should be seen as an integral part of the process and a strength rather than a weakness. Reflecting on our subjectivity is referred to as â€˜reflexivityâ€™ and acknowledging this is an important part of writing up our thematic analysis. In this example, our own experiences of child raising and understanding of gender may impact our view of the data, and how we articulate our initial codes.\n"
			+ "Article annotated with initial codes\n" + "Analysis example: 3\n"
			+ "Once you have generated your initial codes, you will then go back through the data and codes again to see if they can be developed. At this stage, having worked through your transcript, you might start to notice shared meaning across your initial codes. In the code development phase, your â€˜codes can be sharpened or expanded, so that the meaning they capture is associated with more than just one segment of dataâ€™ (Braun and Clarke, 2022, p. 54). Youâ€™re still not at the stage of generating themes here; the purpose of this stage is to tighten the wording of each code to make sure it expresses succinctly whatâ€™s going on in a segment of data.\n"
			+ "Developed codes will help you focus on information in the data that is relevant to answering the research question posed. As you work through this step in our example, keep in mind the research question on which the analysis of the newspaper article here is based:Â How are gender-neutral approaches to parenting described and understood?\n"
			+ "Letâ€™s return to the newspaper article to see how codes can be developed.\n" + "Example 1\n"
			+ "Headline\n"
			+ "To try to capture the articleâ€™s message about the problem of gender stereotypes, the initial codes â€˜luckyâ€™ and â€˜positive experienceâ€™ could be encompassed by the developed code â€˜nonâ€“stereotypical upbringing as positiveâ€™.\n";
